    <description>Used to distinguish multiple fundraising pages created by a single Contact.  Since a single user can sign up multiple people to create fundraising pages, the alias can be used to represent one of the additional supporters.  For example, a parent might sign up their children for fundraising pages.  The parent remains the Contact attached to the fundraising page, and the alias would be the children&apos;s names.</description>
